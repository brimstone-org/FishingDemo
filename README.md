Hello! 

In order to play:
- two players must connect to the game.
- click in the water to launch your line
- click in the water again to pull back your line
- follow the stats at the top for performance update

  Disclaimer!! I got a little side-tracked because I want to get things done perfectly and I wanted to do as many things as I could to show what I know, but I just didn't have time.
  I spent almost 4 hours on the casting system alone because I wanted the line to look as nice as possible and  didn't have time to write cleaner code towards the end.

  Time spent: 13-14 hours
