Hello! This game was done as part of a Game Jam type challenge I had with one of my friends and former colleagues. The task was to make a multiplayer fishing game in 24 hours but I wasn't going to lose sleep over it so I did it in about 10 hours:) The fishing line casting system took me about 4 to 5 hours because I wanted a realisic fishing line. Rest of the time I spent synchronizing the multiplayer like the number of fish spawned, the position of the hook, connecting to the same room etc.

In order to play:
- the start scene is called Lobby
- one client must name a room in the Create Room input field and click "Create room"
- the other must type the same name in the Join Room input field and click "Join Room"
- two players must connect to the game for the game to start
- click in the water to launch your line
- click in the water again to pull back your line
- follow the stats at the top for performance update



  Time spent: ~ 10 hours
